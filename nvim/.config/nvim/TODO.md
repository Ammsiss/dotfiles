### Bugs
- Figure out why I sometimes get errors from neoplug.
- Handle 'no errors' error from Grep user command.
- File tree git highlighting can be erroneous
- Figure out why CTRL-O -> CTRL-I -> repeat, sometimes causes
  error "E19: Mark has invalid line number" (I found this
  doing it in man pages)

### Features
- Add tree view to *filetree.lua* and visual mode selection
  commands.
